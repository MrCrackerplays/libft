/* The memccpy() function copies bytes from string src to string dst.
  If the character c (as converted to an unsigned char) occurs in the
  string src, the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy
  of c in the string dst is returned.  Otherwise, n bytes are copied,
  and a NULL pointer is returned. */
